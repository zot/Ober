Improved hokey help() code


* 2003-03-20 - v0.9.3

Ober.createMain() now reads in $HOME/.oberrc on startup

new commands:
	System.Split -- Create another viewer on the same document.
	System.Exec <java expr> -- execute a java expression enclosed in square brackets (this really just retrieves the first argument as a string and discards it).
	System.Load <filename> -- run commands in a file; each command should be on a separate line.
	System.View <filename> -- view a file, creating a new viewer if necessary.

better error handling so that commands can just throw Exception


* 2003-03-19 - v0.9.2

Ober now supports key bindings. There is only one for now: ctrl-enter executes the command at the beginning of the line.


* 2003-03-14 - v0.9.1

Colors for tags -- make it easier to distinguish viewers and tracks
Namespaces
Better location choosing for new viewers
